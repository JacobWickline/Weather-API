# Weather-API
This website is using two different APIs. WeatherAPI to process the Geolocation entered by the user and OpenWeather API to take the latitude and longitude from the previous API and return the following weather information, weather, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

For the best results, enter City followed with the State.

It somewhat works with zipcodes, but it is a little inaccurate.
